Learned to implement Context API for passing and consuming state throughout the component hierarchy without prop drilling.

Acquired a foundational understanding of Redux, including actions, reducers, store, and unidirectional data flow.

Developed the ability to compare and select appropriate state management techniques based on application size, complexity, and scalability requirements.
