1. By completing this experiment, the following learning outcomes were achieved:

2. Understood the concept of local state management in React using the useState hook and its use for managing component-specific data.

3. Gained insight into global state management and identified situations where shared state is required across multiple components.

4. Learned to implement Context API for passing and consuming state throughout the component hierarchy without prop drilling.

5. Acquired a foundational understanding of Redux, including actions, reducers, store, and unidirectional data flow.

6. Developed the ability to compare and select appropriate state management techniques based on application size, complexity, and scalability requirements.
